# Habit's Calendar
A calendar that specifically helps to track repetitive tasks and make habits of them.
I am creating it with a focus of my needs but with others in mind. I will try my best to make it modular, easy to read and adjust.

In my case this will be displayed on old Windows Tablet not even connected to any network (hence choice of SQLite as local storage + it is fairly easy to switch for e.g. MySQL), but hanged on a wall so I can simply check progress and condition of my habits.

## To Do
- Add user page ‚úîÔ∏è ver. 1.0.5 (09/17/23)
- Allow to add users (mainly because I sometimes need to check how often my son does, or does not do something üòÖ)
- Allow user to add habits
- Add frequency and period for measuring the habit progres (how often do you want to perform it and for how many days)
- Decide how to display tasks (buttons on a calendar or separate frame)
